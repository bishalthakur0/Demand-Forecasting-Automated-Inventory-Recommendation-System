# Demand Forecasting & Automated Inventory Recommendation System

## Owner: Your Name
## Status: In Development
## Version: 1.0

## 1. Problem Statement
Retail and e-commerce businesses often suffer from:
* Overstocking (extra storage cost, product wastage)
* Out-of-stock situations (lost revenue, unhappy customers)
* Manual decision-making that is slow and error-prone

There is a need for an intelligent system that predicts product demand and suggests optimal inventory replenishment quantities automatically.

## 2. Product Goal
Build a Data Science system that:
* Forecasts demand for each product using historical sales data
* Automatically recommends how many units to restock
* Exposes predictions and recommendations through a web dashboard and REST API
* Is deployable and scalable on cloud using Docker

## 3. Core Features (MVP)
| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Data Ingestion | Load data from CSV/database | High |
| Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering | Handle missing values, seasonality, holidays, trends | High |
| Time-Series Forecasting Model | ARIMA/Prophet to predict next 30 days demand | High |
| Recommendation Engine | Suggest optimal reorder quantity based on forecast | High |
| REST API for Prediction | `/predict?product_id=101` returns JSON output | Medium |
| Streamlit Dashboard | Charts, product selection, forecast visualization | Medium |
| Cloud Deployment | Deploy on AWS/Heroku/Render | Medium |
| Docker Containerization | Single command deployment | Medium |

## 4. System Architecture
### Pipeline:
* Load & clean historical sales data
* Train forecasting model (ARIMA/Prophet)
* Store model & forecasts
* API endpoint for real-time prediction
* UI dashboard visualization
* Periodic retraining (optional)

### Tech Stack:
* Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, Prophet
* Flask / FastAPI for APIs
* Streamlit for dashboard
* Docker
* Postgres / SQLite database
* Deploy on AWS EC2 / Render / Streamlit Cloud

## 5. User Personas
| User | Needs |
|---|---|
| Store Manager | Know upcoming demand for each product, avoid stock-outs |
| Business Analyst | Analyze trends, seasonality, and product performance |
| Developer | Access prediction API for integration |

## 6. User Stories
* As a store manager, I want to see 30-day demand forecasts so I can plan stock.
* As an analyst, I want charts showing sales trends.
* As a system, I want to automatically recommend reorder quantities based on safety stock and forecasted demand.

## 7. Functional Requirements
* System must predict demand for N products.
* System must provide forecast visualization.
* API must return predictions in JSON format.
* System must recommend reorder quantity: `reorder_qty = forecasted_demand + safety_stock - current_stock`
* Should work on minimum 1,000+ data points per product.

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements
| Requirement | Goal |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | >80% prediction accuracy |
| Usability | Simple web UI |
| Scalability | Docker-based deployment |
| Performance | API inference < 1 second |
| Security | No exposure of raw customer data |

## 9. Data Requirements
* Historical daily/weekly sales data
* Columns:
    * `product_id`
    * `date`
    * `units_sold`
    * `current_stock`
    * `price`
    * `promotions` (optional)
* Dataset sources: Kaggle Retail Sales Dataset or synthetic dataset

## 10. Success Metrics
* Forecast accuracy (MAPE, RMSE)
* Stock-outs reduction (simulated)
* API response time
* Dashboard usability
* Successful cloud deployment with live URL

## 11. Deliverables
* ML model with forecasting
* Recommendation engine
* Streamlit dashboard
* REST API (Flask/FastAPI)
* Dockerized deployment
* GitHub repo with README + screenshots
* Cloud-hosted working demo
